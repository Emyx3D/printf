.SH NAME
.B _printf
- A re-creation of the printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
It is necessary to #include "holberton.h" header to use the function.
To demonstrate _printf, the example below is used. It is a main function
contained in the file "main.c", located in the test directory that uses
both "_printf" and "printf" to print to the stdout.
The command "gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format *.c" should be used to compile.
The main.c file should be in the same directory as _printf and its other supporting functions
before compiling. The example is as follows;
  
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ cat main.c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "holberton.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */

int main(void)
{
	int len;
	int len2;


	len = _printf("Let's try to printf a sentence.\n");
	len2 = printf("Let's try to printf a sentence.\n");
     
	_printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
	printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len2, len2);
	_printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -9999);
	printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -9999);
	_printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
	printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
	_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
	printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
	len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
	len2 = printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
	_printf("Len:[%d]\n", len);
	printf("Len:[%d]\n", len2);
	return (0);
}

alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format *.c
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ ./printf
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a format which is further described
below. This function write its output to the stdout, the standard output stream.

.SH USAGE
The following key characters preceeded by % symbol called specifiers are needed to use _printf.
.RS 3
%c: Used to print characters
.RS 0
%s: Used to print strings
.RS 0
%d: Prints integers of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%i: Prints integers of max and min size of an int type
.RS 0
%%: Prints the symbol '%'
.SH RETURN VALUES
The _printf() function returns an integer representing the number of symbols
printed not counting \\0 (NULL) for the string.
